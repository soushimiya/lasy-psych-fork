Q: Where should I put my songs?
A: "assets/songs/".

Q: What's the "translations" folder for?
A: This is where I've put the Portuguese translation in, you can also set up other languages inside it easily,
You can turn off languages by deleting the line with "TRANSLATIONS_ALLOWED" inside Project.xml
